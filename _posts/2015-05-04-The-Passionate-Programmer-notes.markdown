已经很久没有读鸡汤文了。不过对这本书里的很多语句感触很深，值得一记

我经常在问自己，为什么总是会不开心。细想，应该是出于对现状的无奈和对自己能力的不满。因此读完本书的导言觉得有些话真是说得鞭辟入里。读书确实是分人和场合的。如果几年之前读到的话，应该不会有这些共鸣吧。

# Forward

You can't be remarkable if you don't love your environment, your tools, and your domain.

leading a remarkable career is the best way I know to kick start that same desire for leading a remarkable life--one where you don't just become a better and more valuable worker, but you become a better human too.

# Introduction

Strangely, we don't all set out on the quest to lead remarkable lives when we start our careers. Most of us are content to go with the flow. Our expectations have been lowered for us by the media and by our friends, acquaintances, and family members. So, leading a remarkable life is something you have to discover as even being a reasonable goal. It's not obvious.

If your life is primarily consumed by your work, then loving your work is one of the most important keys to loving your life. Challenging, motivating, rewarding work is more likely to make you want to get up in the morning than dull, average tasks.

Ultimately, we're all looking for happiness. Once we have our basic human needs like food and shelter taken care of, most of our goals are geared toward finding happiness. Sadly, our activities are often mismatched to that one overarching goal. This is because we as humans get bogged down in the means and forget about the end.

A higher salary might actually be desirable and lead toward happiness. But if you take your eyes off the primary goal, you can find yourself driving toward a higher salary at the expense of your happiness.

You might make more money if you follow this advice. You might gain more recognition or even become famous. But please don't forget that these are not the goals. They're a means to an end.

## Failure Is Off the Radar!

You don't win a race by trying not to lose. And you don't win at life by trying not to suck. Fortunately, the content of the book has never been about trying not to suck. I can't think that way, and neither should you.

The only way to find yourself around those people as often as possible is to become one of those people.

Nobody becomes a musician because they want to get a job and lead a stable and comfortable life. The music industry is too cruel an environment for this to be a feasible plan. People who become professional musicians all want to be great. At least when starting out, greatness is binary in the music world. A musician wants to either be great (and famous for it!) or not do it at all.

It's because a person who wants to be great is far more likely to become great than someone who just wants to do their job. And even if we can't all be Martin Fowler, Linus Torvalds, or the Pragmatic Programmers, setting a high target makes it likely that we'll at least land somewhere far above average.

## You own it

Most people follow everyone else's plan but not their own. To start differentiating yourself, all you have to do is stop and take a good look at your career. You need to be following your plan for you--not theirs.

Think of your career as if it is the life cycle of a product that you are creating. That product is made up of you and your skills.

If you currently find yourself feeling afraid about losing your job, the steps you'll take to build a remarkable career will remove that fear. Remarkable software developers don't languish. They don't find themselves fruitlessly searching for work. So, don't worry. Stay focused on winning, and the fear of losing will be forever a memory

# Part 1 choosing your market

You're about to make a big investment. It may not be a lot of money, but it's your time--your life.

If you think of your career as a business (which it is), your "product" is made up of the services you have to offer.

## Lead or bleed

what I've been talking about is the difference between choosing technologies that are still on the bleeding edge and technologies that are firmly entrenched. Picking a stable technology that has already wedged itself into the production systems of businesses worldwide is a safer, but potentially less rewarding, choice than picking a flashy new technology that nobody has deployed yet.

the old systems don't just die. They are replaced. Furthermore, in most cases, homegrown systems are replaced in stages. In those stages, the old systems have to talk to the new systems. Someone has to know how to make the new speak to the old, and vice versa.

Helping the old systems die comfortably and with dignity is a task that should not be underestimated. And, of course, most people will jump ship before it sinks, either via retirement or by sidestepping into another technology realm. By being the last one left to support still-critical systems, you can pretty much call the shots. It's risky, in that once the technology really is gone, you'll be an expert in something that doesn't exist. However, if you can move fast enough, you can look for the next dying generation of legacy systems and start again.

### Act on It!

1. Make a list of early, middle, and late adoption technologies based on today's market. Map them out on paper from left to right; the left is bleeding edge, and the right is filled by technologies that are in their sunsets. Push yourself to find as many technologies in each part of the spectrum as possible. Be as granular as possible about where in the curve they fall in relation to one another. When you have as many technologies mapped out as you can think of, mark the ones that you consider yourself strong in. Then, perhaps in a different color, mark the ones that you have some experience with but aren't authoritative on. Where are most of your marks on the adoption curve? Do they clump? Are they spread evenly across? Are there any technologies around the far edges that you have some special interest in?

## Supply and Demand

if you're worried about losing employment to offshoring, one strategy would be to avoid the types of work that offshore companies are doing. Offshore companies are doing work that is in high demand. So, focusing on niche technologies is a strategy that, although not necessarily making the competition less fierce (there are fewer jobs to go around), might change the focus of competition from price to ability. That's what you need. You can't compete on price, but you can compete on ability.

To make offshoring work well, many companies realize the need for a reserve of high-end, onshore developers who can set standards, ensure quality, and provide technical leadership. An increase in overall Java programming demand would naturally lead to an increase in this category of Java work. The low-end jobs might be going offshore, but there are more of the elite jobs to go around than there were pre-offshoring. As we saw in the niche job markets, in this tier of Java development work, the competition would shift from price to ability.

The tried-and-true, follow-the-jobs strategy will put you squarely in price competition with offshore developers, because your skills will fit into the offshore-friendly balanced markets. To compete in the mainstream technology market, you'll have to compete at a higher tier. Alternatively, you could exploit market imbalances--going where the offshore companies won't go. In either case, it pays to understand the forces at work and to be skilled and nimble enough to react to them.

### Act on It!
1. Research current technical skill demand. Use job posting and career websites to find out which skills are in high demand and in low demand. Find the websites of some offshore outsourcing companies (or talk to employees of those companies if you work with them). Compare the skills available via these companies with the high-demand list you compiled. Make note of which skills appear to be in high demand domestically with little penetration offshore. Do a similar comparison between leading-edge technologies and the skills available via offshore outsourcing firms. Keep your eyes on both sets of technical skills that are underserved by the off-shore companies. How long does it take for them to fill the holes (if ever)? This time gap is the window during which a market imbalance exists.

## coding don't cut it anymore 

a software person should understand a business domain not only well enough to develop software for it but also to become one of its authorities.

You should think of your business domain experience as an important part of your repertoire. If you're a musician, when you add something to your repertoire, it doesn't just mean you've played the song once. It means you truly know the song. You should apply the same theory to your business domain experience. For example, having worked on a project in the health insurance industry doesn't guarantee that you understand the difference between an HIPAA 835 and an HIPAA 837 EDI transaction. It's this kind of knowledge that differentiates two otherwise equivalent software developers in the right situation.

You might be "just a programmer," but being able to speak to your business clients in the language of their business domain is a critical skill.

In light of the importance that you should place on selecting a business domain when rounding out your portfolio, the company and industry you choose to work for becomes a significant investment on your part. If you haven't yet given real, intentional thought to which business domains you should be investing in, now is the time. Each passing day is a missed opportunity. Like leaving your savings in a low-yield savings account when higher interest rates are to be had, leaving your development on the business front in stasis is a bad investment choice.
 
### Act on It!
1. Schedule lunch with a businessperson. Talk to them about how they do their job. As you talk to them, ask yourself what you would have to change or learn if you aspired to have their job. Ask about the specifics of their daily work. Talk to them about how technology helps them (or slows them down) on the job. Think about your work from their perspective.

Do this regularly.

2. Pick up a trade magazine for your company's industry. You probably don't even have to buy one. Most companies have back issues of trade rags lying around somewhere. Start trying to work your way through a magazine. You may not understand everything you read, but be persistent. Make lists of questions you can ask your management or business clients. Even if your questions seem stupid to you, your business clients will appreciate that you are trying to learn.
Look for industry websites that you can monitor on a regular basis. In both the websites and the magazines, pay special attention to what the big news items and the feature articles are about. What is your industry struggling with? What's the hot new issue right now? Whatever it is, bring it up with your business clients. Ask them to explain it and to give you their opinions. Think about how these current trends affect your company, your division, your team, and eventually your work.

## Be the worst

Being the worst guy in the band means always playing with people who are better than you.

Attempting to be the worst actually stops you from selling yourself short. You might belong in the A band but always put yourself in the B band, because you're afraid. Acknowledging outright that you're not the best wipes away the fear of being discovered for the not-best person you are. In reality, even when you try to be the worst, you won't actually be.

### Act on It!

1. Find a "be the worst" situation for yourself. You may not have the luxury of immediately switching teams or companies just because you want to work with better people. Instead, find a volunteer project on which you can work with other developers who will make you better via osmosis. Check for developer group meetings in your city, and attend those meetings. Developers are often looking for spare-time projects on which to practice new techniques and hone their skills.

If you don't have an active developer community nearby, use the Internet. Pick an open source project that you admire and whose developers appear to be at that "next level" you're looking to reach. Go through the project's to-do list or mailing list archives, pick a feature or a major bug fix, and code away! Emulate the style of the project's surrounding code. Turn it into a game. Make your design and code so indistinguishable from the rest of the project that even the original developers eventually won't remember who wrote it. Then, when you're satisfied with your work, submit it as a patch. If it's good, it will be accepted into the project. Start over, and do it again. If you've made decisions that the project's developers disagree with, either incorporate their feedback and resubmit or take note of the changes they make. On your next patch, try to get it in with less rework. Eventually, you'll find yourself to be a trusted member of the project team. You'll be amazed at what you can learn from a remote set of senior developers, even if you never get a chance to hear their voices.

## Invest in Your Intelligence

we were more likely to extend offers to candidates with diverse (and even unorthodox) experience than to those whose experiences were homogenous. My explanation is that either good people seek out diversity, because they love to learn new things, or being forced into alien experiences and environments created more mature, well-rounded software developers.

### Act on It!

1. Learn a new programming language. But, don't go from Java to C# or from C to C++. Learn a new language that makes you think in a new way. If you're a Java or C# programmer, try learning a language like Smalltalk or Ruby that doesn't employ strong, static typing. Or, if you've been doing object-oriented programming for a long time, try a functional language like Haskell or Scheme. You don't have to become an expert. Work through enough code that you truly feel the difference in the new programming environment. If it doesn't feel strange enough, either you've picked the wrong language or you're applying your old way of thinking to the new language. Go out of your way to learn the idioms of the new language. Ask old-timers to review your code and make suggestions that would make it more idiomatically correct

## Don't Listen to Your Parents

your parents are going to give you fear-driven advice. Fear-driven advice is geared toward not losing. Thinking about not losing is not the way to win! Winners take risks. They think about where they want to go--not where the rest of the pack is. Fear-driven career planning is more likely to land you in a cubicle farm for the rest of your life than on the path to greatness. Sure, it's safe, but it's no fun.

And without fun, there's unlikely to be any passion in a software job.

The more domains you've seen and the more technical architectures you've slogged through, the more prepared you are to make the right decisions on tougher projects.

Take calculated risks with your career. Don't let fear consume you. And if you're not having fun, you're not going to be excellent.

### Act on It!

1. What are your biggest career fears? Think about the last few career choices you made. They don't have to be big decisions (after all, if you're making fear-driven choices, your decisions likely aren't big anyway). They could be whether you took on special assignments or whether you applied for a job change or promotion. Make a list of these choices, and, for each one, force yourself to make an honest assessment: how much was your decision driven by fear? What would you have done if fear had not been a factor? If the decision was indeed fear-driven, how can you reverse it or find a similar opportunity in which to make the less fear-driven choice?
