# Introduction: The man and his Mission

During the Great Leap Forward, more than thirty million of the people had died.

# From Revolutionary to Builder to Reformer, 1949 - 1969

Liu was considered more kindly towards the troops than Deng, who demanded more of his charges and was ready to be bold in advancing to fight the enemy. Liu was also more reluctant than Deng to execute soldiers suspected of spying for the Guomindang.

Unlike Ye Jianying in south China, who was criticized for being too soft on local landlords, Deng was praised by Mao for his success in land reform by attacking landlords, killing some of the landlords with largest holdings, allocating their land to peasants, and mobilizing local peasants to support the new leadership.

In 1953, when Bo Yibo lost his position as finance minister because Mao complained that he had been too soft in assessing taxes on the capitalists, Mao appointed Deng to replace him.

During the anti-rightist campaign, Deng strongly supported Mao in defending the authority of the party and in attacking the outspoken intellectuals. These attacks, and Deng’s role in them, would not be forgotten by China’s intellectual elite

(in 1969) after the first military clash with the Soviet Union, Mao directed that a number of high-level leaders be sent to the countryside so that if the Soviets were to invade, they could organize local resistance…… Some astute Beijing observers believe that Lin Biao, worried about possible rivals, used the danger of Soviet attack to persuade Mao to exile other high-level officials in Beijing who might have threatened his power. 

# Banishment and Return, 1969 - 1974

People who knew Deng would say that although he did not let personal emotions influence his decisions in meting out punishments for most people, he was especially severe in insisting that Nie Yuanzi be imprisoned for ten years for launching the political attacks at Peking University that culminated in Pufang’s paralysis and the death of some sixty people at the university. 

After 1994 Deng Xiaoping was no longer mentally alert; it is reported that Zhuo Lin, upset when Zhifang was criticized for corruption, took drugs to attempt suicide. She was saved and in the end Zhifang was not punished. 

Deng Rong said that her father got along with all ten marshals except one, Lin Biao.

Some believed that Zhou also wept for himself. Until that point, he had been able to avoid the suspicion and wrath of Mao that had led to the death of two number twos, Liu Shaoqi and Lin Biao. He had managed to remain number three, but now he was number two, and he knew Mao would be suspicious. Indeed, within two years Mao would attack him. 

Zhou’s attempts to help the victims of the Culture Revolution, however, were limited by his fear of enraging Mao. … (in 1956) Zhou upset Mao when he told him privately that he could not in good conscience support some of his economic policies. After being criticized then, Zhou went to extraordinary lengths for the next fifteen years to give Mao no reason to doubt his total commitment to carry out the Chairman’s wishes. Even so, in January 1958, Mao exploded at Zhou, saying Zhou was only fifty meters away from being a rightist, an accusation that led Zhou to back down.

Throughout Chinese history, as emperors aged and their energy declined, they often stopped seeing a broad range of officials and narrowed their contacts to an inner cabinet of fawning eunuchs. After Lin Biao’s death, Mao similarly rarely saw any officials, including Deng, and relied primarily on three women (Zhang Yufeng, Tang Wensheng, Wang Hairong) to keep him posted about the outside world 

Zhou told Mao of Kissinger’s suggestion that Washington might be able to win Congressional approval to advance toward normalization of the U.S.-China relationship if the Chinese could be somewhat more flexible than in the Japanese formula and allow Washington to maintain closer relations with Taiwan. Nancy Tang chimed in at that point, telling Mao that it sounded like a “two-China policy” (Zhou later confessed to Kissinger that “when we were with the Chairman, I dared not explain the statement, but she dared to make an explanation.”) When Mao heard that Zhou was seriously listening to Kissinger’s proposals allowing the United States to keep a stronger relationship with Taiwan as well as with the mainland, Mao, the elemental patriot, was furious at Zhou.

From November 25 to December 5, 1973, immediately after Kissinger’s visit, Mao organized a series of Politburo struggle sessions against Zhou Enlai in the Great Hall of the People. After Lin Biao’s death, Mao had taken little interest in details of daily work, but he micromanaged the criticism of Zhou by selecting who would attend, outlined what they would say, and setting the overall tone of the meetings. In his view Zhou was close to being a rightist capitulationist. All the Politburo members were required to publicly criticize him, Zhou wrote a detailed self-criticism, but Mao judged it inadequate, demanding that Zhou compose another one that condemned his own actions even more strongly.

Deng knew very well that what he said at the meetings to criticize Zhou would be reported to Mao by the two ladies. Near the end of the meetings, Deng said to Zhou, “You are only one step away from the Chairman. Others could hope for such a position, but it would be unattainable; for you it is attainable. I hope you will take this as an adequate warning.” On the surface Deng’s words may not have seemed vicious, but in the context they were damning. In effect, Deng had implied that there was a danger Zhou might try to upstage Mao and usurp his role. When the two ladies reported Deng’s comments to Mao, Mao was thrilled, and immediately invited Deng in for a talk.

It was discovered that Lin Biao had written notes in the margins of things he had read, showing he had great respect for Confucius; the campaign against him and someone else accused of being too Confucian, Zhou Enlai, was therefore called “Criticize Lin, criticize Confucius”

# Bringing Order under Mao, 1974 - 1975 

In Deng’s view, for organizational reliability, a team of leaders was better than a single leader, no matter how able. Something might happen to one leader, but if there were a small team, then others would be ready to take over if problems arose. Ideally, these leadership team members would not only be able to provide overall leadership when needed but would also develop specialized knowledge in the areas to which they were assigned.

# Looking forward under Mao, 1975

During the Cultural Revolution, one out of every 250 scientific personnel at the CAS, where the vast majority of high-level scientists were concentrated, had been persecuted to death; in the CAS Shanghai branch the figure was one out of every 150 scientists.

In 1965, on the eve of the Cultural Revolution, there had been some 106 research centers under CAS, with 24,714 scientific and research personnel. In 1975, by contrast, CAS had been reduced to thirteen research institutes, two research offices, and about 2,000 employees, of whom 1,800 were officials or researchers and 200 were lower-level support staff. Many of the scientists who had been sent to the countryside had not yet returned.

Mao complained to his nephew (Mao Yuanxin) about Deng and his consolidation efforts at Tsinghua University. Mao was also furious about the document on science; he zeroed in on one sentence that Hu Qiaomu had inserted in the final draft quoting Mao as saying that "science and technology consitute a force of production". Mao insisted that he had never said that.

Deng showed courage when he argued that the social sciences were important enough to deserve a separate academy.... (On August 30, 1975) Hu (Qiaomu) laid out plans for developing an independent acedemy that would later be known as the CASS (Chinese Academy of Social Sciences) 

The question of how Deng might treat Mao's reputation after his death was too sensitive to discuss directly; they brought it up indirectly, by discussing how Khrushchev had savaged Stalin's reputation. Deng's critics warned that he could end up being China's Khrushchev

# Sidelined as the Mao Era Ends, 1976

Within a single year, between December 1975 and September 1976, four senior Chinese leaders passed away. First Kang Sheng, the master internal spy who had done the dirty work for Mao in arranging the killing of hundreds of officials accused of betraying the revelution, died in December 1975.

When Zhou passed away before Mao, it allowed Mao to shape the nature of Zhou's funeral arrangements -- and he used the occasion to try to dampen the public memory of Zhou, offering what was by party standards only minimal recognition of Zhou's service.

But Mao did not attend the service. Three days before the service was to be held at the Great Hall of the People, Mao scoffed to his boyguard Wang Dongxing, "Why do I have to go to the service?" He instructed his personal assistant Zhang Yufeng to explain simply that he was unable to be there (even though, just a few weeks later, Mao was well enough to meet former president Nixon for a full hour and forty minutes)...... Mao, though far more mobile than Zhou, never once visited him in the hospital. Mao also tried to dampen foreigners' celebration of Zhou.

# Three Turning Points, 1978

Deng was concerned about the personal loyalty of another high-level military official who was stationed in the Northeast at the port of Dalian, Admiral Su Zhenhua. Su had served under Deng in the Second Field Army, but he had not proved very loyal; when officials were called upon to attack Deng in 1976 he had been more critical of Deng than Deng judged necessary....Shortly after being criticized, Su was notified that Hua Guofeng would stop in the Northeast on the way back from his trip to North Korea. Aware of the rivalry between Deng and Hua Guofeng and unhappy about being criticized, Su Zhenhua offered to hold a naval exercise with some 120 ships as part of the welcoming ceremony when Hua arrived in Dalian. When Deng heard that Su was planning to give such a display of support for Hua, he was furious and used his leverage over the military to have the military exercise cancelled. During his visit to the Northeast, Deng wanted to make sure that there were no remnants of military support for Hua Guofeng.  

Marshal Ye, who quickly realized how much the changed atmosphere had weakened the support for Hua Guofeng, advised Hua on November 11 to begin preparing a speech showing that he, too, accepted the changes. The crucial drama took place between November 11 and November 25. By the time Deng joined the conference on November 15, its focus had already shifted from economics to politics, and the political winds were blowing against Hua and his "two whatevers." Some senior party leaders would later remark that just as the Zunyi conference had been the decisive turning point in Mao's rise to the chairmanship, so this work conference proved the decisive event in the rise of Deng.

Deng expressed the prevailing view at high levels that China's two huge disasters, the Great Leap and the Culture Revolution, were caused by a system that allows one person to dominate without any input from other voices. China therefore needed to develop a legal system so that a single individual, no matter how able, will not dominate. If laws are initially imperfect and incomplete, they can be made fair and just, step by step, over time.

# Setting the limits of Freedom, 1978 - 1979

Other articles spoke against the "two whatevers" and raised questions not only about Lin Biao and the Gang of Four, but even about Mao. "Just ask yourself," one article read, "Without Mao's support could Lin Biao have achieved power? Just ask yourself: Didn't Chairman Mao know that Jiang Qing was a traitor? If Chairman Mao had not agreed, could the Gang of Four have achieved their aim of striking down Deng Xiaoping?"

He encouraged more democratic discussion within the party. But when protestors attracted huge crowds and resisted basic rule by the Communist leadership, Deng moved decisively to suppress the challenge. As one provincial first party secretary later said, Deng's view of democracy was like Lord Ye's view of dragons. "Lord Ye loved looking at a book with pretty pictures of dragons (*Yegong haolong*), but when a real dragon appeared, he was terrified"

# The Soviet-Vietnamese Threat, 1978 - 1979

(P283) The fear intensified during the Culture Revolution when China began sending radio messages into those countries to encourage the local people to carry out revolution. At the time of Deng's visit, these radio appeals had not yet stopped. The problem was mostly acute in Indonesia, where local Chinese had joined in the resistance to Sukarno that had nearly toppled his government. (Indonesia, furious, did not normalize relations with China until 1990.)

(P285) In the 1950s the Communist movement in the British colony of Malaya was so strong that many Malayas had feared that the Communists might take over after Malaysian independence. After Malaysian independence was achieved in 1963, the Malays were afraid that the ethnic Chinese, who had a strong political party, would dominate their government. To Avoid this, Singapore, 75 percent ethnic Chinese and a part of Malaya, was cast out in 1965 and forced to become independent. 

# Opening to the United States, 1978 - 1979

(P342) Deng was fascinated by O'Neill's discussion of the separation of powers, especially the ways in which the legislative and executive branches competed for power and influence.... Deng had absolutely no doubt that, at least for China, the separation of powers was a terribly inefficient way to run a country, something China should avoid

# Launching the Deng Administration, 1979 - 1980

(P367) Not only did he want the writers to do more to stress the positive things that Mao stood for, but he also pressed them to acknowledge that Mao's mistakes were primarily systemic and institutional. Deng accepted Hu Qiaomu's point that the drafters had no choice but to acknowledge the errors of the Great Leap Forward (in which, unlike those of the Cultural Revolution, Deng had been deeply involved). Deng insisted, however, that in dealing with the Greap Leap, the drafters should begin by listing some of the positive achievements during that period and only thereafter acknowledge the weaknesses.

(P372) Why did Marshal Ye defend Hua Guofeng? ... as other party officials argue, Marshal Ye was concerned that Deng might become too authoritarian -- that he would behave too much like Mao -- and he thus sought to retain Hua as a way of constraining Deng's power and promoting inner-party democracy. 

Marshal Ye was not a strong-willed person who fought for his convictions; he preferred to avoid confrontation. He accepted the Politburo's decision on Hua, and in fact engaged in a mild self-criticism for his support of Hua. Indeed, once Deng became head of the CMC, Marshal Ye chose not to share this responsibility with Deng but to withdraw to his home base in Guangdong, where his son Ye Xuanning was already mayor of Guangzhou and vice governor and where he could enjoy a comfortable life. ... Later, when Marshal Ye was critically ill in 1984 and 1986, Deng did not pay a courtesy visit as he had done for Zhou. Marshal Ye died in 1986.

# Deng's Art of Governing

## Speak and act with authority

## Defend the party

## Maintain a unified command structure

## Keep a firm grip on the military

## Build public support before promoting

## Avoid taking the blame

When Deng's policies proved unpopular or mistaken, subordinates were ordinarily expected to take responsibility, just as Mao's errors were blamed on Lin Biao, Jiang Qing, and low-level officials. In a country where discipline at the top still depended on personal authority, Deng, like many other high party officials, believed that it was sometimes necessary to sacrifice the pawns to ensure continued respect for the king and his throne.

## Set short-tem policies in light of long-term

## Pursue policies that help achieve long-term goals

## Uncover even the unpleasant truths

## Be bold

## Push, consolidate, and push again

## Strengthen unity, minimize divisions

## Avoid publicizing past grievances

## Sidestep conservative resistance through experimentation

## Use aphorisms to explain complex controversial issues

## Make balanced presentations that explains underlying principles

## Avoid factionalism and select competent officials

## Study and shape the "Atmosphere"

# Experiments in Guangdong and Fujian, 1979 - 1984

(P412) Guangdong officials regarded him as a constant thorn in their side. All high officials except Chen Yun and Li Xiannian made at least one visit to the SEZs and praised their achievements. Chen Yun went south every winter, to Hangzhou, Shanghai, and elsewhere, but he explained that his health did not permit him to visit Guangdong.
