# Chapter 1 Causes

As societies become intellectually mature, it has been claimed, their writers seem increasingly to replace specific verbs with abstract nouns. 

1a. The Committee **proposal** would provide for biogenetic industry **certification** of the **safety** to human health for new substances requested for **exemption** from Federal rules

1b. The Committee **proposes** that when the biogenetic industry **requests** the Agency to **exempt** new substances from Federal rules, the industry will **certify** that the substances are **safe**.

These nouns alone make a style more abstract, but they encourage more abstraction: once a writer expresses actions in nouns, she can then eliminate whatever (usually concrete) agents perform those actions along with those whom the actions affect

These abstract Romance nouns result in a prose that we variously call gummy, turgid, obtuse, prolix, complex, or unreadable.

# Chapter 2 Clarity

## The First Two Principles of Clear Writing

- The subjects of the sentences name the case of characters, 
- the verbs that go with those subjects name the crucial actions those characters are part of.

When your prose feels turgid, abstract, too complex, do two things, First, locate the case of characters and the actions that those characters perform (or are the objects of). If you find that those characters are not subjects and their actions are not verbs, revise so that they are.

## Some stylistic Consequences

- You may have been told to write more specifically, more concretely.
- You may have been told to avoid using too many prepositional phrases.
- You may have been told to put your ideas in a logical order
- You may have been told to use connectors to clarify logical relationships
- You may have been told to write short sentences.

## Looking for Nominalization

1. When the nominalization follows a verb with little specific meaning, change the nominalization to a verb that can replace the empty verb.

    The police *conducted* an **investigation** into the matter.

    The police ***investigated*** the matter.

    The committee *has* no **expectation** that it will meet the deadline.

    the Committee does not ***expect*** to meet the deadline.

2. When the nominalization follows *there is* or *there are*, change the nominalization to a verb and fill a new subject: 

    *There is* a **need** for further study of this program.

    The *engineering stuff* **must study** this program further.

    *There was* considerable **erosion** of the land from the floods.
    *The floods* considerably **eroded** the land.

3. When the nominalization is the subject of an empty verb, change the nominalization to a verb and find a new subject:

    The **intention** of the IRS is to audit the records of the program.

    The IRS **intends** to audit the records of the program.

    Our **discussion** concerned a tax cut.

    We **discussed** a tax cut.

4. When you find consecutive nominalizations, turn the first one into verb. Then either leave the second or turn it into a verb in a clause beginning with *how* or *why*:

    There was first a **review** of the **evolution** of the dorsal fin.

    First, she **reviewed** the **evolution** of the dorsal fin.

    First, she **reviewed** how the dorsal fin **evolved**.

5. We have to revise more extensively when a nominalization in a subject is linked to a second nominalization in the predicate by a verb or phrase that logically connects them

    Subject:            Their **cessation** of hostilities
    
    Logical connection: was because of

    Object:             their personnel **losses**.

    To revise such sentences,

    (a) Change abstractions to verbs: *cessation* -> *cease*, *loss* -> *lose*

    (b) Find Subjects for those verbs: ***they*** *ceased*, ***they*** *lost*

    (c) Link the new clauses with a word that expresses their logical connection. That connection will typically be some kind of causal relationship;

    To express simple cause:        *because*, *since*, *when*

    To express conditional cause:   *if*, *provided that*, *so long as*

    To contradict expected cause:   *though*, *although*, *unless*

    Schematically, we do this:

    Their **cessation** of hostilities  -> they **ceased** hostilities
    
    was because of                      -> because
    
    their personnel **losses**          -> they **lost** personnel
